# Space X Investigation Project

## ðŸ”­ Background

SpaceX is the most successful rocket launching company. One of their rocket -- Falcon 9 launches cost ~100 million less than other rocket launches. The reason behind it is Falcon 9 can reuse the first stage of landing.


We would like to investigate how to perform a successful first stage landing by analysing the independent variables to launch Falcon 9. Our aim is to determine the factors that affect the successful rate of Falcon 9 rocket.

## ðŸ”­ Outline
1. Provide graphs to show the relationship between different elements of the rocket and its success rate
2. Find out which variables affect the success rate of Falcon 9 rocket
3. Apply algorithm to predict the successful rate of the future first stage of landing
